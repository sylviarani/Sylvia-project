Reflection When I look at my original digital literacy narrative and compare those initial ideas to how I feel about writing with digital technologies now, I feel that I have achieved significant growth with this topic. Specifically, I believe that I have laid the foundation for understanding what goes on underneath the layer of simplified user interface on my computer. Below are some thoughts about each assignment. Static site v1 My experimentation with the HTML static site assignment taught me the importance of file location and keeping things organized so that they could be usable. I\u2019ve never been the type of person to rename my graphic files. This, I realized, was because I never had to\u2014a string of random numbers was a perfectly usable file name if I was importing the files simply by dragging and dropping the file into whatever format I was using. Experimenting with writing HTML taught me the value of putting a little extra time into setting up my workspace and website \u201cingredients\u201d before diving into the project. Client project During the client project, I would not say that I learned anything particularly new about the inner workings of my digital technologies, but I did learn how to communicate ideas about content strategy with teammates. Working on the project in a group format allowed me some practice working with others to design a website layout, and it was through this practice that I became familiar with the terminology that I needed to communicate ideas about design and format. Markdown assignment When we started this semester, I had only used Sublime text for editing SRT files, and I did not understand that you could use a text editor to save files as whatever format you wanted them. The markdown assignment went a further step past HTML to teach me another language that my computer could read and understand. Now, I notice what applications use markdown. For example, the Notes app on my phone and computer are markdown applications\u2014when you type an asterisk, it turns it into a bullet point. This is something that I probably would have never figured out without this introduction to markdown. Structured authoring with DITA When I began reading about DITA as an \u201cinformation authoring system,\u201d I was admittedly confused about what this even meant. Now I understand it as an approach to organizing information that breaks it up into small, specific pieces to be reused and reorganized. I also understand, now, the usefulness of DITA as a technical writer. I can see how this application may be useful when writing about long processes and especially in making user manuals. Hosted static site + final thoughts When I consider this semester and the challenges I faced, I see a clear theme. I find that I am the type of person who likes to focus on aesthetics and user interface. This is why I gravitate to programs like Google Docs and Wix. I like when a computer program takes care of the basic stuff so I can focus on the content and design of my information. This attitude can be a bit incongruous with the concepts that we learned in this class, which focused more on foundational knowledge and the processes that these other programs are based on. Now, I have created this site as a testament to my understanding of these concepts. I also can reflect on my original digital literacy narrative and I see where I was wrong. When I read my original statement that \u201cI can learn everything from Google,\u201d it now seems a bit arrogant to me. While trying to learn these concepts, there was a lot of understanding that I would not gain simply from Googling. Google works when I am trying to get a quick answer for a small problem. However, understanding DITA and why it is useful, hosting on Github, and managing file locations on my computer\u2026 these are things that I had to learn either by doing them myself, or having someone help me and explaining things as we did them. I would not have been able to figure out Github without the help of my friend Joe. I would not have been able to get the images to work if it were not for someone more experienced to explain to me that file names are case-sensitive and that a .JPG was different to my computer than a .jpg. Overall, I feel like I have developed a greater understanding of writing with digital technologies and I feel confident that I can add these skills to my resume.","title":"Digital Literacy Narrative and Reflection"},{"location":"Digital-Literacy-Narrative.html#digital-literacy-narrative","text":"","title":"Digital Literacy Narrative"},{"location":"Digital-Literacy-Narrative.html#original-digital-literacy-narrative","text":"Here is a link to my original digital literacy narrative.","title":"Original Digital Literacy Narrative"},{"location":"Digital-Literacy-Narrative.html#reflection","text":"When I look at my original digital literacy narrative and compare those initial ideas to how I feel about writing with digital technologies now, I feel that I have achieved significant growth with this topic.

Overview This video was a great intro to color contrasting and it gave me some tools to start with. Key takeaways What did I gain from watching this video? The Color Contrast Deep Dive was useful to me because it gave me tools for accessible color contrast, a concept that I had only really understood in an abstract sense. It helped me to understand that color contrast is measurable important and sometimes, subjective. I found the WAVE tool to be helpful, and I saved this tool for later use. I also found it interesting that, after explaining that color contrast is based on math and ratios, the presenter went on to explain that sometimes a high contrast ratio will still be difficult to read, and that designers should \u201cuse your best judgement.\u201d She showed an example where a WCAG-compliant contrast ratio actually made text less usable. Reflection How does this video connect or extend the topics in class? After watching these videos, I am left with a new understanding of accessibility. This is an interesting topic because it is both subjective and objective. We can rely on tools to create more accessible online spaces, but ultimately it is up to each programmer\u2019s individual discretion to decide what is best for their users.","title":"Markdown"},{"location":"markdown_assignment.html#accessibility-ambassadors","text":"By Sylvia Rani For this asignment, I will be writing about the Color Contrast Deep Dive video from the UMN Accessibility Ambassadors conference.","title":"Accessibility ambassadors"},{"location":"markdown_assignment.html#overview","text":"This video was a great intro to color contrasting and it gave me some tools to start with.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"markdown_assignment.html#key-takeaways","text":"What did I gain from watching this video?
