## Reflection

When I look at my original digital literacy narrative and compare those initial ideas to how I feel about writing with digital technologies now, I feel that I have achieved significant growth with this topic. Specifically, I believe that I have laid the foundation for understanding what goes on underneath the layer of simplified user interface on my computer. Below are some thoughts about each assignment.

### Static site v1

My experimentation with the HTML static site assignment taught me the importance of file location and keeping things organized so that they could be usable. I’ve never been the type of person to rename my graphic files. This, I realized, was because I never had to—a string of random numbers was a perfectly usable file name if I was importing the files simply by dragging and dropping the file into whatever format I was using. Experimenting with writing HTML taught me the value of putting a little extra time into setting up my workspace and website “ingredients” before diving into the project.

### Client project

During the client project, I would not say that I learned anything particularly new about the inner workings of my digital technologies, but I did learn how to communicate ideas about content strategy with teammates. Working on the project in a group format allowed me some practice working with others to design a website layout, and it was through this practice that I became familiar with the terminology that I needed to communicate ideas about design and format. 

### Markdown assignment

When we started this semester, I had only used Sublime text for editing SRT files, and I did not understand that you could use a text editor to save files as whatever format you wanted them. The markdown assignment went a further step past HTML to teach me another language that my computer could read and understand. Now, I notice what applications use markdown. For example, the Notes app on my phone and computer are markdown applications—when you type an asterisk, it turns it into a bullet point. This is something that I probably would have never figured out without this introduction to markdown.

### Structured authoring with DITA

When I began reading about DITA as an “information authoring system,” I was admittedly confused about what this even meant. Now I understand it as an approach to organizing information that breaks it up into small, specific pieces to be reused and reorganized. I also understand, now, the usefulness of DITA as a technical writer. I can see how this application may be useful when writing about long processes and especially in making user manuals.

### Hosted static site + final thoughts

When I consider this semester and the challenges I faced, I see a clear theme. I find that I am the type of person who likes to focus on aesthetics and user interface. This is why I gravitate to programs like Google Docs and Wix. I like when a computer program takes care of the basic stuff so I can focus on the content and design of my information. This attitude can be a bit incongruous with the concepts that we learned in this class, which focused more on foundational knowledge and the processes that these other programs are based on. Now, I have created this site as a testament to my understanding of these concepts.
I also can reflect on my original digital literacy narrative and I see where I was wrong. When I read my original statement that “I can learn everything from Google,” it now seems a bit arrogant to me. While trying to learn these concepts, there was a lot of understanding that I would not gain simply from Googling. Google works when I am trying to get a quick answer for a small problem. However, understanding DITA and why it is useful, hosting on Github, and managing file locations on my computer… these are things that I had to learn either by doing them myself, or having someone help me and explaining things as we did them. I would not have been able to figure out Github without the help of my friend Joe. I would not have been able to get the images to work if it were not for someone more experienced to explain to me that file names are case-sensitive and that a .JPG was different to my computer than a .jpg.
Overall, I feel like I have developed a greater understanding of writing with digital technologies and I feel confident that I can add these skills to my resume.
