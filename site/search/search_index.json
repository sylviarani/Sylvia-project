Overview This video was a great intro to color contrasting and it gave me some tools to start with. Key takeaways What did I gain from watching this video? The Color Contrast Deep Dive was useful to me because it gave me tools for accessible color contrast, a concept that I had only really understood in an abstract sense. It helped me to understand that color contrast is measurable important and sometimes, subjective. I found the WAVE tool to be helpful, and I saved this tool for later use. I also found it interesting that, after explaining that color contrast is based on math and ratios, the presenter went on to explain that sometimes a high contrast ratio will still be difficult to read, and that designers should \u201cuse your best judgement.\u201d She showed an example where a WCAG-compliant contrast ratio actually made text less usable. Reflection How does this video connect or extend the topics in class? After watching these videos, I am left with a new understanding of accessibility. This is an interesting topic because it is both subjective and objective. We can rely on tools to create more accessible online spaces, but ultimately it is up to each programmer\u2019s individual discretion to decide what is best for their users.","title":"Markdown"},{"location":"markdown_assignment.html#accessibility-ambassadors","text":"By Sylvia Rani For this asignment, I will be writing about the Color Contrast Deep Dive video from the UMN Accessibility Ambassadors conference.","title":"Accessibility ambassadors"},{"location":"markdown_assignment.html#overview","text":"This video was a great intro to color contrasting and it gave me some tools to start with.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"markdown_assignment.html#key-takeaways","text":"What did I gain from watching this video?
